## Methodology

- **Facial landmark detection** using OpenCV for feature extraction
- **CNN architecture** for emotion classification
- **Cross-cultural validation** with participants from 5 different cultural groups
- **Statistical analysis** of recognition accuracy patterns

## Technical Implementation

Deep learning model trained on augmented facial expression datasets with careful attention to cultural representation and bias mitigation.

## Contributions

Published findings contribute to understanding of emotional intelligence assessment tools and their cultural validity.
