## Research Goals

Investigate relationships between lifestyle factors, environmental conditions, and sleep quality through comprehensive data analysis.

## Data Sources

- **Wearable device data** (heart rate, movement, temperature)
- **Environmental sensors** (light, noise, humidity)
- **Daily self-report questionnaires** (mood, stress, caffeine intake)
- **Sleep diary entries** with subjective quality ratings

## Analytics Approach

Statistical modeling using R with machine learning algorithms in Python to identify predictive factors for sleep quality.

## Key Findings

Identified significant correlations between evening light exposure and sleep onset latency, informing personalized sleep hygiene recommendations.
