## Overview

A comprehensive system for monitoring stress through physiological signals including heart rate variability, skin conductance, and movement patterns.

## System Components

- **Wearable sensors** for continuous physiological monitoring
- **Machine learning models** for stress classification
- **Real-time dashboard** for data visualization
- **Intervention protocols** based on mindfulness techniques

## Implementation

The system uses Arduino-based sensors to collect physiological data, which is processed using Python and TensorFlow for real-time stress classification.

## Results

Achieved 87% accuracy in stress detection across a validation study with 45 participants.
