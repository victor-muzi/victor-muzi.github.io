# Hi! I'm Victor Muzi

<strong>Honours Class I / Manuscript in Preparation</strong>

I'm seeking research positions where I can apply my hands-on research experience and statistical training to advance our understanding of human behaviour.

For my honours thesis, I integrated archival child data with experiments I administered to adults, revealing through mixed-effects modelling and SEM how cognitive flexibility and inhibition - not age alone - interact with environmental complexity to predict road-crossing safety. Currently preparing this work as a first-author publication with my supervisor and international collaborator at Goethe University Frankfurt.


### What I bring to research teams

* **Full research pipeline experience:** From SONA participant recruitment to publication-ready manuscripts  
* **Statistical analysis:** Mixed-effects modelling, SEM, bootstrapping (HD in all quant courses)  
* **Data wrangling:** Integrated 3 archival datasets into 2,000+ trial analysis  
* **Software:** R, Python, Jamovi, SPSS, MATLAB, Excel/Google Sheets, Microsoft Power BI


**Available immediately** for research positions in Wollongong/Sydney. WWCC cleared.
