## Introduction
### **From Manipulation to Cooperation: Redirecting High-Machs’ Behaviour with Strategic Information**  
Machiavellianism (Mach)—a part of the 'dark triad' of personality traits alongside psychopathy and narcissism—is characterised by manipulation, cynicism, and a pragmatic yet self-serving sense of morality (Christie and Geis, 1970). Individuals with high levels of Machiavellianism (High-Machs" hereafter) exhibit a cold and calculating approach, often engaging in self-serving behaviours to the detriment of others (Paulhus & Williams, 2002). Cynicism (C hereafter) is noteworthy here as it indicates that High-Machs expect others to behave as they do: deceitfully and selfishly. That is, C, the *anticipation* of untrustworthy (U hereafter) behaviour from others, parallels Machs' *propensity* for such ‘U’ behaviour (Orbell & Dawes, 1993).  
Research on the Five-Factor Model (FFM) provides converging evidence for this U and C relationship in people. There is a negative correlation between Mach and the trait of Agreeableness (Lee & Ashton, 2005), indicating that Agreeableness partially captures Mach. This trait consists of six highly-correlated facets including Trust, Altruism, and Morality. (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Trust is the inverse of C as it involves perceiving others as fundamentally good and trustworthy. Altruism and Morality, representing a selfless desire to help others and an inclination towards honest communication respectively (Costa & McCrae, 1992), indicate an inverse of U.   
The Trust Game is a useful tool to study the behaviours exhibited by High-Machs. In this economic game, two players interact: one player receives an initial sum of money, decides how much to send to the second player, with the sent amount being tripled upon receipt. The second player then decides how much to return. This game allows researchers to study trust and reciprocity behaviours (Baumert et al., 2014; Müller & Schwieren, 2020; Ruch et al., 2017), and it reveals the stability of both self-reported and game-measured prosocial behaviours over time and across different games (Peysakhovich et al., 2014).  
In such games, High-Machs’ behaviours propagate distrust, which in turn reinforces their cynicism (Orbell & Dawes, 1993). Even minor signals of distrust can trigger interpersonal retaliation from the other player (Pillutla et al., 2013). This cycle is further sustained through asymmetric feedback: betrayed trust leads to painful disappointment, making individuals warier. Conversely, by opting not to trust, people miss feedback where trust would have otherwise been rewarded (Fetchenhauer & Dunning, 2010). As a result, High-Machs can interpret this feedback as a confirmation of their cynical outlook, thereby reinforcing their beliefs.  
U and C are detrimental to the individual's psychological well-being and health (Stavrova & Ehlebracht, 2019\) and to others (Kish-Gephart et al., 2010). For instance, these traits propagate unethical behaviours in the workplace, such as dishonesty and sabotage, damaging the organisational culture (Kish-Gephart et al., 2010). Mitigating such behaviours in High-Machs is challenging due to their indifference towards how they impact others and their distrust towards professional advice, including therapists (Harrell, 1980; Furnham et al., 2013). Also, they usually only seek help due to external pressures, but traits such as a lack of motivation to change hinder therapeutic progress (Furnham et al., 2013). Thus, effective strategies to manage High-Machs are needed (Furnham et al., 2013; Massey-Abernathy & Byrd-Craven, 2016).  
### **Proposal for Behavioural Change and Rationale**  
Research suggests that High-Machs can behave prosocially when it aligns with their self-interest (Belschak et al., 2015), such as in workplaces that incentivize and reward ethical conduct (Ruiz‐Palomino, 2019). Personalised, clear information has been found to enhance decision-making overall (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). Lastly, High-Machs are more likely to modify their behaviour when self-motivated (Ruiz‐Palomino, 2019\) and driven by financial rewards (Birkás et al., 2015). Combining these elements, we propose providing High-Machs with clear, strategic information showing that trust and reciprocation are advantageous in a trust game. This approach encourages a self-initiated change rather than relying on Machs to follow advice and is also stimulated by the game’s monetary rewards. We will use an "indefinite Trust Game" structure to mitigate potential end-game effects, especially from High-Machs who may exploit knowledge of the game's endpoint to defect in the final round. This setup creates a "shadow of the future" effect where the possibility of future interactions encourages sustained cooperation (Bó, 2005; Camera & Casari, 2009). This consistent cooperation is to maximize the opportunity for cognitive dissonance to influence High-Machs' behaviours and attitudes.  
Adopting prosocial behaviours might change High-Machs' self-perceptions and attitudes, disrupting the cycle discussed earlier (Fetchenhauer & Dunning, 2010; Orbell & Dawes, 1993). It may also instigate cognitive dissonance, a psychological tension due to incongruity between self-perceptions and behaviours, triggering further adjustments in their attitudes (Gosnell, 2018). By doing so, we fill the gap in understanding whether clear, strategic information can drive behavioural change in High-Machs, especially in contexts outside of the workplace (Ruiz‐Palomino, 2019). Further research is also required to understand how the adoption of prosocial behaviours could affect the self-perceptions and attitudes of High-Machs towards others (Belschak et al., 2015\)  
Our hypotheses are: (1) Mach scores will predict the degree of behavioural adjustment towards more prosocial actions in the Trust Game after receiving strategic information (Ruiz‐Palomino, 2019; Birkás et al., 2015). (2) Post-experiment, High-Machs will score lower on the Mach-IV and expect more cooperation from future game partners (Fetchenhauer & Dunning, 2010; Gosnell, 2018). By testing these hypotheses, we aim to elucidate the potential for behavioural change in High-Machs and inform the development of interventions to encourage prosocial shifts in this demographic.  
## **Methodology**  
### **Participants**  
Participants will be first-year psychology students recruited via Sona, incentivized by course credits and potential game earnings. A target sample size of 230 has been calculated with G\*Power (Faul et al., 2009\) to ensure the detection of significant effect sizes. Participants familiar with the Trust Game are excluded to prevent strategy bias.  
### **Design and Procedure**  
We will implement a five-stage, within-subjects design: (1) Participants will complete the Mach-IV scale and a Trust Game expectation measure online three days before playing to limit the influence of self-reporting on game behaviour (Podsakoff et al., 2003). (2) Participants, randomly paired, will partake in two Trust Game rounds in a computer lab, playing as both sender and receiver to establish baseline behaviours. (3) A brief explanation highlighting trust and reciprocation as the optimal Trust Game strategy will be provided. (4) Participants are informed they will undertake six additional rounds, paired with new partners, with roles alternating each round. This approach controls for the influence of prior game interactions on behaviour and expectation. It also promotes equal influence on game outcomes, enhancing behaviour representation. Upon completion participants will be debriefed and given the opportunity to ask any questions about the research. (5) Participants will retake the Mach-IV scale and additional measures three days post-experiment to compare pre- and post-game measures effectively. This delay is to mitigate the potential influence of immediate game outcomes on post-intervention self-reports (Podsakoff et al., 2003).  
All participants will provide informed consent prior to the study, ensuring they understand the nature of the research, their involvement, potential risks, and benefits. Participants will retain the right to withdraw from the study at any point without penalty. Furthermore, participant data will be handled confidentially and securely, adhering to data protection laws and ethical guidelines (American Psychological Association, 2017).  
### **Measures**  
***Machiavellianism:*** Measured by the 20-item Mach-IV scale (Christie & Geis, 1970). Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale, providing a total score ranging from 20 to 140, with higher scores indicating greater Machiavellianism.  
***Expectations:*** A custom measure, based on a 7-point Likert scale, will gauge participants' expectations of Trust Game partner cooperation at both stages, with higher scores indicating higher levels of expected cooperation.  
***Prosocial Behaviour:*** Participants' decisions in the Trust Game serve as a quantifiable measure of prosocial behaviour. For instance, as senders, the amount of money they decide to send will be used as a measure of trust, while as receivers, the amount they decide to return will be used as a measure of reciprocation.  
### **Data Analysis**  
To test the first hypothesis, we will carry out a mediation analysis to establish the extent to which the participants' Mach-IV scores can predict their responses to strategic information. The response will be determined by noting the differences in participants' game behaviours before and after the intervention. For the second hypothesis, the analysis will be conducted solely on data gathered from participants classified as High-Mach. In previous literature, High-Mach has typically been identified as those ranking in the top 20% on the Mach-IV scale (Christie & Geis 1970; Lee & Ashton, 2005). We will compare the game expectations and Mach-IV scores of High-Machs using paired-samples T-tests. One T-test will be used to compare the Mach-IV scores before and after the experiment, and another will be used to compare scores on our custom game expectations scale.
