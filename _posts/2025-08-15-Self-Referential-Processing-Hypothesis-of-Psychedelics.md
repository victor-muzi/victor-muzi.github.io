## Executive-summary abstract

Classic psychedelics modulate large-scale brain networks via 5‑HT2A receptor activation, reliably reducing Default Mode Network (DMN) segregation while increasing global integration. Because the DMN supports self-referential processing and rumination, its down-weighting predicts reductions in self-focused cognition. Convergent evidence from meditation research shows similar DMN downregulation correlating with reduced rumination. Linguistic analysis reveals that depressed individuals use significantly more first-person singular pronouns - a behavioral marker of excessive self-focus. I propose that psychedelics' therapeutic effects partially arise from breaking this self-referential loop: DMN disruption → reduced self-focus → decreased rumination → improved mood and increased empathy. This hypothesis yields testable predictions: successful psychedelic therapy should show correlated decreases in (1) DMN connectivity, (2) first-person pronoun frequency in speech/writing, and (3) rumination scores. I outline how natural language processing could track these changes in clinical trials, providing an objective linguistic biomarker for the subjective experience of 'ego dissolution' and its therapeutic correlates.

## Introduction


Classic psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin, LSD, DMT/ayahuasca) are distinguished by their primary action as 5‑HT2A receptor agonists. Rather than simply stimulating or sedating, they reorganize large-scale brain networks in ways that participants consistently describe as qualitatively different from ordinary intoxication: perception becomes vivid and associative, thought patterns feel less constrained, and one’s sense of self can loosen or even dissolve. 

While cocaine predictably triggers euphoria through dopamine release, and benzodiazepines induce sedation via GABA enhancement, psychedelics have no singular emotional signature. Instead, as 5-HT2A receptor agonists, they fundamentally reorganize cortical network dynamics, particularly disrupting the Default Mode Network's usual patterns. This distinction matters because psychedelics do not simply activate a 'feel better' circuit, but rather alter the brain's connectivity architecture itself, producing what Carhart-Harris terms 'neural flexibility'. The subjective experience varies dramatically with set and setting precisely because psychedelics amplify and reorganize existing conscious content rather than imposing a fixed pharmacological state. Expectedly, participants in Johns Hopkins studies consistently report clarity rather than intoxication.

This network reorganization may explain why psychedelic therapy shows promise across diverse conditions. Unlike dopamine-driven stimulant psychosis (treatable with D2 antagonists), psychedelic effects are blocked by 5-HT2A antagonists like ketanserin, confirming their distinct mechanism. The key appears to be how psychedelics disrupt the brain's habitual self-focus—a disruption that, I'll argue, shows up in everything from brain scans to word choice.

Specifically, I propose that psychedelics work primarily by relaxing the brain's self-system, particularly the Default Mode Network. The DMN maintains our narrative self through constant self-referential processing and rumination. When psychedelics quiet this network, self-focused cognition decreases. This shift should be measurable at multiple levels: reduced DMN segregation in brain imaging, fewer self-referential pronouns (I/me/my) in speech, and decreased rumination with increased empathy. The same mechanism explains why certain meditation practices, which also reduce DMN activity, produce overlapping therapeutic effects.

### The self-system and the Default Mode Network

The DMN is a set of midline and lateral regions (prominently medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate/precuneus) that are more active during internally oriented mentation—autobiographical memory, future simulation, self-evaluation—than during externally focused tasks. Across development, DMN connectivity emerges early and continues to mature through childhood and adolescence as a stable narrative “self” takes shape. In adults, the DMN participates in self-referential processing and is consistently implicated in pathological self-focus: depressive rumination, for example, shows altered DMN activity and connectivity.


This neural story aligns with small but reliable linguistic signals. People who are more self-focused and dysphoric tend to use first-person singular pronouns at higher rates; meta-analytic work links “I/me/my” frequency to depressive symptoms and related risk markers (Edwards & Holtzman, 2017), with important context-dependence clarified by multi-lab work (Tackman et al., 2018). While pronoun counts are not diagnostic and capture only a sliver of a broader construct, they serve as a convenient, behavioral window into self-referential stance.

A helpful computational framing is predictive processing: the brain is a hierarchical prediction machine that uses high-level “priors” to interpret incoming signals. On this view, the sense of being a continuous self is a high-level generative model supported by DMN dynamics. When this model is precise and dominant, self-focused narratives are sticky; when its precision is relaxed, alternative interpretations and bottom-up signals gain influence. This is the lens through which I interpret the psychedelic state.

### Psychedelics reorganize networks

Neuroimaging under psilocybin and LSD shows a reproducible pattern: reduced integrity (within-network coherence) of the DMN alongside increased communication across normally segregated networks. Graph-theoretic analyses reveal higher global integration and altered community structure—the brain is less modular and more globally connected during the acute state (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014; Petri et al., 2014). Phenomenologically, this looser, more integrated mode of processing is associated with experiences of ego dissolution or self-transcendence. Participants often report that the ordinary boundary between “me” and “not me” softens or disappears; in the laboratory, higher ratings of this state correlate with both the intensity of network reorganization and, importantly, with clinical improvements in some trials.

Note that this is not simply “more activity everywhere”, but rather a redistribution of influence. High-level, self-related priors (with the DMN as a central hub) lose precision; associative and sensory systems contribute more to conscious content. That helps explain the distinctive mixture of vivid imagery, autobiographical insight, and a sense of salience or meaning. It also provides a mechanistic interpretation of a common anecdote: that one can “communicate with the subconscious” on higher doses. In predictive terms, loosening top-down self-model constraints allows previously suppressed or backgrounded material—memories, emotions, latent associations—to surface and be integrated.

### The “interpreter module” and narrative self
Split-brain work famously highlighted a left-hemisphere “interpreter” that confabulates coherent narratives out of whatever behavior or perception is available (Gazzaniga; popularized by Haidt). This language system is not the DMN, but it is functionally coupled to it: the DMN supplies autobiographical, self-relevant content; language networks give it narrative form. In ordinary life, this interpreter streamlines and rationalizes our actions under a stable self-model. Under psychedelics, when the precision of that model is relaxed, the interpreter has less top-down guidance. People often report a reduction in internal commentary or a shift from analytical narrative to more direct, present-centered experiencing. If the narrative self’s gravitational pull weakens, we would expect less linguistic self-reference immediately after the experience and more “world-” or “other-” oriented descriptions—a prediction that can be tested.

### From self-focus to mood and empathy
If the DMN enables self-referential processing and if excessive self-focus fuels negative affect, then attenuating DMN dominance should relieve rumination and depressed mood. Early clinical work with psilocybin in depression and anxiety disorders suggests that the intensity of “mystical-type” or self-transcendent experience correlates with symptom reduction (e.g., Griffiths et al., 2006; Garcia-Romeu et al., 2016). Acute studies also report increased emotional empathy under psilocybin (Pokorny et al., 2017). A straightforward interpretation is that, with the narrative self temporarily down-weighted, cognitive and affective resources can be reallocated: away from self-referential loops and toward connection and perception. That does not mean the DMN is “the ego” or that it is the only network involved—salience and control networks shift as well—but the DMN provides a tractable, well-studied anchor for the self-focus mechanism.

### Convergence with meditation
Meditation provides an independent model of self-model attenuation. Neuroimaging work in experienced meditators shows reduced DMN activity during focused attention and open monitoring, and long-term practitioners often report decentering and selflessness. Classical descriptions speak of a “reducing valve” that ordinarily narrows the flood of experience; both psychedelics and sustained contemplative practice appear to widen it. While the routes differ—training versus pharmacology—the overlaps in network dynamics and phenomenology support a shared mechanism. Importantly, not all meditation techniques reduce DMN dominance to the same degree; effects vary by practice, expertise, and context. Likewise, psychedelics modulate multiple networks beyond the DMN, and ego dissolution is neither necessary nor sufficient for clinical benefit in every case. The claim here is modest but concrete: a measurable component of both states is reduced self-referential dominance, which should be observable in brain connectivity and in language.

### Summary

Psychedelics appear to work, in part, by relaxing the brain’s entrenched self-model: the DMN’s grip on cognition loosens, cross-network communication expands, and conscious experience becomes less self-referential and more open. If that is right, we should be able to see it simultaneously in neural measures (reduced DMN segregation), in language (reduced first-person singular and related self-focus markers), and in mood (reduced rumination and depression; sometimes increased empathy and connectedness). Meditation offers convergent evidence for the same mechanism via a different route. This cross-level account is precise enough to generate testable predictions and to guide measurement in contemporary psychedelic trials.
