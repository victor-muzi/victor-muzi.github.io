## General Overview


Psychedelics are a class of hallucinogenic drugs ("hallucinogens") that produce mind-altering and reality-distorting effects technically called hallucinations. However, the sorts of hallucinations experienced by schizophrenics are very different from the visual distortions experienced by psychedelics. Also, schizophrenic hallucinations are never triggered by psychedelics, but only by stimulant drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine, which increase levels of dopamine (See: [The Dopamine Hypothesis of Schizophrenia](https://psychscenehub.com/psychinsights/the-dopamine-hypothesis-of-schizophrenia/){:target="_blank"}). In turn, antipsychotic medications used to treat disorders such as schizophrenia decrease the levels of dopamine, making people sluggish and demotivated.

A friend and science author, Anticode, explains the connection:

> "One of [the schizophrenics I befriended], more introspective than the others, remarked that the delusions and confusion is typically accompanied by a "eureka moment". He said that this made it very difficult to ignore the nonsense because they felt, beyond a doubt, like good, right ideas. They felt like truth in the way that only truth can (its chemical manifestation, at least).
>
> The same sort of dopamine-ping (which is a reinforcer more than it is a motivatorâ€”important distinction) is present when manic people drift into psychosis. One too many dopamine pings, one too many errant thoughts integrated as valid-beyond-a-doubt.
>
> Same with amphetamine psychosis. Dopamine goes apeshit. Everything feels meaningful so people become a slavering wreck as their brain continuously reinforces neural pathways that serve no purpose or have no value."

And from Nature, a weekly international journal publishing the finest peer-reviewed research in all fields of science and technology, [*No Link Found between Psychedelics and Psychosis*](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.16968){:target="_blank"}:


### 1.1 Mechanism of Action
Test.
> "Data from population surveys in the United States challenge public fears that psychedelic drugs such as LSD can lead to psychosis and other mental-health conditions and to increased risk of suicide. The findings are likely to raise eyebrows. Fears that psychedelics can lead to psychosis date to the 1960s, with widespread reports of "acid casualties" in the mainstream news. But Krebs says that because psychotic disorders are relatively prevalent, affecting about one in 50 people, correlations can often be mistaken for causations. "Psychedelics are psychologically intense, and many people will blame anything that happens for the rest of their lives on a psychedelic experience."

Psychedelics work differently from other drugs in that they don't induce any particular feeling. For instance, cocaine increases dopamine, making the user feel awake, motivated, euphoric, et cetera. Valium increases GABA, producing relaxing effects and slowing neuronal firing. On the other hand, psychedelics have a more general impact on the functioning and connectivity of the brain.
